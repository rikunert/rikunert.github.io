Interested in data science? Welcome to Rich Data.

I did my PhD in the neurosciences of music and language at the [Max Planck Institute
for Psycholinguistics](http://www.mpi.nl/) in Nijmegen (The Netherlands).

I am lead data scientist at [StackFuel](https://stackfuel.com/).

I am ready to help your business excel through my data analysis and visualisation skills as well as my expertise in experimental design.
Check out my blog for little data science pet projects.
For more details, see [my CV](http://rikunert.com/cv).

My previous blog, [Brain's Idea](https://brainsidea.wordpress.com/), ran from January 2012 to March 2017, focusing on the science of the mind and brain.
It earned accolades such as being featured on wordpress Freshly Pressed, the BPS research digest (twice), and the Smithsonian magazine.
Its posts show how my interests gradually shifted from psychological science to data science.
At some point, a new topic asked for a new infrastructure and name.
And so Rich Data was born.
