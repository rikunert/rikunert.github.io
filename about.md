Interested in data science? Welcome to Rich Data.

I did my PhD in the neurosciences of music and language at the [Max Planck Institute
for Psycholinguistics](http://www.mpi.nl/) in Nijmegen (The Netherlands).
I am now looking for a job in industry.
You might want to see this blog as my application portfolio.
For more details, check out [my CV](rikunert.com/CV).

My previous blog, [Brain's Idea](https://brainsidea.wordpress.com/), ran from January 2012 to March 2017, focusing on the science of the mind and brain.
It earned accolades such as being featured on wordpress Freshly Pressed, the BPS research digest (twice), and the Smithsonian magazine.
Its posts show how my interests gradually shifted from psychological science to data science.
At some point, a new topic asked for a new infrastructure and name.
And so Rich Data was born.
