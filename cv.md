## Currently

Freelance data scientist.

## Key skills

### Critical analysis

I bring a critical eye to data analysis in order to look beyond the surface aesthetics and reveal the underlying dynamics. For example, by digging deeper in a published data set, I have revealed signs of questionable research practices throughout psychological science, see [publication](http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-016-1030-9/fulltext.html). This is but one example of how I work: fast, creatively, critically.

### Synthesizing & explaining complex data

I used to write for award winning science blogs in Dutch ([Donders Wonders](http://blog.donders.ru.nl/)) and English ([Brain’s Idea](http://brainsidea.wordpress.com)). I now blog at rikunert.com on data science. Besides, I have authored [seven scientific articles](http://rikunert.com/publications) and published lay versions on my blog.

### Team work

I function in a great variety of professional settings, and in many roles. For example, during my PhD I headed several international collaborations associated with my research projects. Moreover, I joined the editorial board of the Donders Institute blog.

### Independent problem solving

I finished my PhD on time despite minimal supervision and challenges along the way because I persevered and sought creative solutions. Afterwards, I acquired Git, Shiny, and Python by myself.

### Taking responsibility

Since my student days I have held various positions of responsibility from being a class representative to restarting a student union.  During my PhD I was responsible for convening lab meetings and organizing an international tour for my student choir.
